# Softmax Classification Using PyTorch

In this project, we build a softmax classification model using PyTorch to classify Iris flowers into one of three species based on their features.

## 1. Data Preparation

### Step 1: Load and Preprocess Data

1. **Load the Dataset**
   We use the Iris dataset from `sklearn.datasets`, which contains measurements for Iris flowers and their corresponding species.

2. **Standardize Features**
   Features are standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

3. **One-Hot Encode Labels**
   Labels are converted into one-hot encoded format using `OneHotEncoder`.

4. **Convert to PyTorch Tensors**
   The standardized features and one-hot encoded labels are converted into PyTorch tensors and moved to the GPU.

### Step 2: Train-Test Split

1. **Split Data**
   The dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`.

## 2. Model Definition

### Step 1: Define the Model Architecture

1. **Softmax Classification Model**
   - **Linear1 Layer:** Fully connected layer with input dimension (4) to hidden layer (10 neurons).
   - **Sigmoid Activation:** Applied to the output of the first linear layer.
   - **Linear2 Layer:** Fully connected layer from the hidden layer (10 neurons) to the output dimension (3 neurons, one for each class).
   - **Softmax Activation:** Applied to the output of the second linear layer to produce probabilities.

```python
class SoftmaxClassification(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim):
        super(SoftmaxClassification, self).__init__()
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, 10)
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(10, output_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear1(x)
        x = nn.Sigmoid()(x)
        x = self.linear2(x)
        x = nn.Softmax(dim=1)(x)
        return x
```

## 3. Training

### Step 1: Initialize Model, Loss, and Optimizer

1. **Initialize Model**
   Create an instance of the `SoftmaxClassification` model with input dimension 4 and output dimension 3.

2. **Define Loss Function**
   Use `CrossEntropyLoss` for classification.

3. **Set Up Optimizer**
   Use `AdamW` optimizer for training with a learning rate of 0.01.

### Step 2: Training Loop

1. **Training Process**
   - Iterate over epochs, compute loss, and update model parameters.
   - Track the loss values for visualization.

2. **Plot Training Loss**
   - Plot the loss over epochs using Matplotlib to visualize the learning process.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot(range(epochs), losses, 'g')
plt.xlabel('Epochs')
plt.ylabel('Loss')
plt.title('Training Loss over Epochs')
plt.show()
```

## 4. Evaluation

### Step 1: Evaluate the Model

1. **Model Performance**
   Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on the test set.

## Example Usage

To use the trained model for classification, you would follow these steps:

```python
import torch

# Example data (features)
example_data = torch.tensor([[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]], dtype=torch.float32).to('cuda')

# Prediction
model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    output = model(example_data)
    predicted_class = torch.argmax(output, dim=1)
    print(f'The predicted class is: {predicted_class.item()}')
```
